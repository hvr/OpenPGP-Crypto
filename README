OpenPGP-Haskell

This is an OpenPGP library inspired by my work on OpenPGP-PHP <http://github.com/bendiken/openpgp-php>.

It defines types Message and Packet to represent OpenPGP messages as series of packets and then defines instances of Data.Binary for each to facilitate encoding/decoding.

There is also a wrapper around <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/Crypto> that currently does fingerprint generation and signature verification.

It is intended that you use qualified imports with this library.  If importing both modules, something like this will do:

> import qualified Data.OpenPGP as OpenPGP
> import qualified Data.OpenPGP.Crypto as OpenPGP
