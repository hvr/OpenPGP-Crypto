This is an OpenPGP library inspired by my work on OpenPGP libraries in
Ruby <https://github.com/singpolyma/openpgp>,
PHP <http://github.com/singpolyma/openpgp-php>,
and Python <https://github.com/singpolyma/OpenPGP-Python>.

It defines types to represent OpenPGP messages as a series of packets
and then defines instances of Data.Binary for each to facilitate
encoding/decoding.

There is also a wrapper around <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/Crypto>
that currently does fingerprint generation, signature generation, and
signature verification (for RSA keys only).

It is intended that you use qualified imports with this library.  If importing
both modules, something like this will do:

> import qualified Data.OpenPGP as OpenPGP
> import qualified Data.OpenPGP.Crypto as OpenPGP
